🌐 USB Hub PCB with Integrated Control & Communication
This versatile USB hub PCB is designed for demanding embedded and industrial applications, integrating multiple I/O options and intelligent onboard control:

🔌 USB 3.2 Type-C port – High-speed data and power transfer

⚡ Power Delivery up to 5A – Supported via USB 3.1 Type-A and Type-C ports

🌍 Ethernet (RJ45) port – Provides reliable wired network connectivity

💾 SD & microSD card slots – Enable full read/write access for embedded file management, not just storage expansion

🔁 RS485 transceiver (supports full-duplex and half-duplex) – Ideal for industrial serial communication protocols

🧠 STM32F411 microcontroller – Serves as the core controller of the board:

Manages communication between peripherals

Controls register access and configuration settings

Coordinates USB and serial communication logic

🧩 Modular PCB design – Easy to embed in custom devices and enclosures

The STM32F411 ensures that the board functions not just as a passive hub, but as a smart interface controller, capable of autonomous operation, flexible configuration, and robust communication with host systems.
